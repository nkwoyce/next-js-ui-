            </h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              These Terms of Use and any access to or use of the Website shall
              be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws in
              force in the Province of Ontario and the federal laws of Canada
              applicable therein.
            </p>
            <p>
              If any claim, dispute or controversy occurs between CorpRite and a
              User relating to the interpretation or implementation of any of
              the provisions of these Terms of Use, such dispute shall be
              resolved by private, confidential and binding arbitration, rather
              than in court. Such arbitration shall be conducted by a single
              arbitrator. The arbitrator shall be appointed by agreement of the
              parties or, in the absence of an agreement, such arbitrator shall
              be appointed by a judge upon the application of either the User or
              CorpRite. Arbitration shall be held in the Province of Ontario,
              unless otherwise agreed by the parties, and may be conducted
              remotely if permitted by the arbitrator. The arbitration procedure
              to be followed shall be agreed by the parties or, in absence of an
              agreement, determined by the arbitrator. The arbitration shall
              proceed in accordance with the provisions of the Arbitration Act,
              1991, SO 1991, c 17. Subject to any right of appeal, the decision
              arrived at by the arbitrator shall be final and binding. Judgment
              upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any
              court having jurisdiction.

              By using the Website, you agree to resolve any claim or dispute

              hereby waive any right you may have to commence or participate in
              any class action lawsuit commenced against CorpRite or its
              affiliates related to any claim, dispute or controversy arising
              from your use of the Website. Where applicable, you hereby agree

              Users understand that CorpRite acts as the data processor for

              service provider. Partners agree not to misrepresent the platform
              as a provider of legal advice. All data and activity associated
              with subdomain instances (e.g., [company].corprite.co) are subject
